Package needed to boot Droidian on a Xiaomi Pocophone X3 Pro


## Fixes information

### droidian-berb-fix-squeekboard-delayed.service: Squeekboard takes too long to appear
Squeekboard seems to be executed as a desktop link in /usr/share/applications (there is two destop links related: sm.puri.OSK0.desktop and sm.puri.Squeekboard.desktop)
The problem is not a squeekboard related, is a problem with the phosh autostart applications which delays the executions too long.
To solve the problem for squeekboard, the user .profiles found in all home dirs, are configured to call the binary.
To avoid a crash when the desktop links are executed, the binary is renamed to squeekboard2

If problems are detected, stop and disable the service droidian-berb-fix-squeekboard-delayed.service

### droidian-berb-fix-bluetooth-inotify-autorestart.service
May happen that the bluetooth service hangs if the controller is managed from the Phosh GUI until the bluetooth service is restarted.
For this cases, this fix monitors the bluetooth service and auto-restart it when some event on rfkill devices is detected, and the bluetooth service is not responding. 

Also there is the file /var/lib/bluetooth/inotify-macs.allow that can be used to add bluetooth device MACs (one per line), and the autorestart will be done on every rfkill event detection for that devices.

The service is enabled by default, if problems are detected, stop and disable the droidian-berb-fix-bluetooth-inotify-autorestart.service

A log registry is writed every time the bluetooth service is autorestarted (/var/log/droidian-adaptation/droidian-adaptation-bluetooth-inotify-autorestart.log)

### droidian-berb-fix-appstreamcli-apt-glib-stdout.service
This service hides some glib error messages in stdout when appstreamcli is called by apt-update

### droidian-berb-fix-flash-bootimage-xiaomi-vayu.service
Fixes a problem with the getprop binary in the flash-bootimage script that chashes the linux-bootimage installation if the auto flash is enabled in kernel-info.mk

2024-06-26: (included in droidian10 adaptation) Since depending the vendor image used, different ro.product.vendor.model values are detected, so the ro.product.vendor.device property will be used instead. This update patches the flash-bootimage script to do it. Also update the FLASH_INFO_MODEL value in kernel-info.mk and rebuild the linux-image packages has been needed.

### droidian-berb-fix-phosh-brightness-xiaomi-vayu.service
Sets the brightness to half after phosh is started since the device is booting with the value to 200 (very low)
